# RubberDucky-Payloads
This repository contains the Arduino code to create a DigiSpark rubber ducky. Also included are two payloads that spawn and execute a reverse shell and a keylogger on the victim system. Without using obfuscation methods, the keylogger and the reverse shell achieved a maximum score of 7 out of 61 antivirus programs that were able to detect the signature, which is already a very good result. With obfuscation methods, a significantly better rate is achievable. The video shows a demonstration of the hacking session.
